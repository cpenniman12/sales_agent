# Key Gaming GPU Technologies

## NVIDIA DLSS 3

DLSS 3 (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is a revolutionary technology that uses AI to generate entire frames independently of the GPU rendering pipeline, dramatically multiplying frame rates while delivering crisp image quality. 

DLSS 3 combines three technologies:
- Super Resolution: AI-based upscaling for higher frame rates
- Frame Generation: AI generates entirely new frames
- NVIDIA Reflex: Reduces system latency

## NVIDIA Reflex

NVIDIA Reflex reduces system latency to make games more responsive, giving players a competitive edge. Up to 50% lower latency in supported games means faster target acquisition, quicker reaction times, and more precise aim.

## Third-Gen Ray Tracing Cores

The Ada architecture features 3rd generation ray tracing cores with twice the throughput of the previous generation, plus new hardware for Ray Tracing to Denoising Acceleration. Experience fully ray-traced games with the highest levels of detail at playable frame rates.

## Fourth-Gen Tensor Cores

Ada's 4th generation Tensor Cores deliver massive boosts to AI performance with FP8 acceleration and provide twice the throughput of the previous generation. These cores power DLSS and other AI-based features.

## AV1 Encode

GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs feature dual eighth-gen NVIDIA encoders (NVENC) that can deliver better quality than x264 while using 40% less bandwidth. They also add support for AV1 encoding, enabling higher resolution streaming to platforms like Twitch and YouTube.

## G-SYNC

NVIDIA G-SYNC eliminates screen tearing by synchronizing the refresh rate of compatible G-SYNC displays to the frame rate of GeForce RTX GPUs. The result is silky-smooth gameplay without distracting visual artifacts.
